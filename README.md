# Credit-Rating-Prediction
This project involved analysing bank and credit-related data from a leading financial company. The goal was to develop targeted products for users by categorizing them into three credit score brackets: Poor, Standard, and Good.

Notice that this project has been developed together with other two collaborators (and fellow colleagues) as a group-project for a BSc Course in Data Analysis for Business.
